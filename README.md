# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification

Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The primary objective was to train the CNN to achieve high accuracy (>90%) in classifying images of paper, rock, and scissors. The model is tailored to recognize and differentiate among the three distinct categories.
